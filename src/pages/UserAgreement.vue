            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Our Obligations</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">3.1 Subject to these Terms and Conditions, we agree to provide the service to you using
                reasonable care. The Service may not be available in whole or in part in certain regions,
                countries, or jurisdictions.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">3.2 We are not obligated to process any particular transaction. When you submit a Transaction,
                you are requesting that we process the Transaction on your behalf. We may, in our sole
                discretion, choose whether or not to accept the offer to process that Transaction. However, if
                we decide not to process the Transaction, we will notify you promptly of that decision and
                refund the money paid to us.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">3.3 TRANXFA reserves the right to modify or discontinue the service or any part of the service
                without notice, at any time and from time to time. We may, in our absolute discretion, refuse
                any Transaction or limit the amount to be transferred, either on a per-transaction basis or on
                an aggregate basis, and either on individual accounts or on related accounts.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">3.4 We may, in our sole discretion, refuse transactions from certain senders or to certain
                recipients, including but not limited to entities and individuals on restricted or prohibited
                lists issued from time to time by the Canadian government and the regulators. In addition, not
                all Payment Instruments are available to all customers at all times, and we may, in our sole
                discretion, refuse Transactions funded from certain Payment Instruments.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">3.5 We will attempt to process transactions promptly, but any transaction may be delayed or
                canceled for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: our efforts to verify your
                identity; to validate your transaction instructions; to contact you; or otherwise to comply with
                applicable law; or due to variations in business hours and currency availability.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">3.6 We will attempt to provide Senders and Recipients with up to date information regarding the
                location and opening hours of our Service Providers by means of information on our website.
                However, you agree that TRANXFA shall not be held responsible for any inaccuracies that may
                appear in that information or any consequential loss that may result from incorrect or
                incomplete information.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Your Obligations</h2>

            <p class="text-lg">You agree that:</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.1 You will not access, use, or attempt to use the Service as a Sender unless you are at least
                18 years old and have the legal capacity to form a binding legal contract in the relevant
                jurisdiction.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.2 For each transaction that you submit, you will pay us the service fee in addition to the
                transaction amount. Payment becomes due at the time that you submit your transaction. If you
                submit a transaction that results in TRANXFA becoming liable for charges, including but not
                limited to chargebacks or other fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.3 In connection with your registration and use of the Service, you will:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>4.3.1 Provide us with true, accurate, current, and complete evidence of your identity, and
                    promptly update your personal information if and when it changes.</li>
                <li>4.3.2 Provide our merchant with details of one or more payment instruments.</li>
                <li>4.3.3 Provide us with true, accurate, and current complete information for all transactions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg">We do not accept any liability for damages resulting from non-payment or delay in payment of a
                money transfer to a recipient or failure to perform a transaction under the service by reason of
                any of these matters.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.4 When you pay for a transaction in one currency and the recipient is paid in another currency,
                there will be a difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the
                exchange rate provided to you. TRANXFA and its service providers usually make a small profit in
                these circumstances. If such an account is denominated in another currency, the amount to be
                received by the recipient will be reduced by the amount of extra charges incurred by reason of
                the incorrect information provided by you, and we will have no obligation to compensate for such
                a reduction.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.5 When you are sending money under these Terms and Conditions, it is your responsibility to
                ensure that all the transaction details are accurate before submission. Once a transaction has
                been submitted for processing it is not normally possible to change any of its details. You will
                be given the opportunity to confirm transactions before submission and you must check the
                details carefully.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.6 TRANXFA will have no responsibility for any fees or charges you may incur by the use of a
                particular Payment Instrument to fund a transaction. These may include but are not limited to
                unauthorised overdraft fees imposed by banks if there are insufficient funds in your bank
                account or "cash advance" fees and additional interest which may be imposed by credit card
                providers if they treat use of the service as a cash transaction rather than a purchase
                transaction.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.7 You will only use the Service to send money to people whom you know personally and not to pay
                for goods or services. If, in breach of this clause, you choose to pay third parties for goods
                and services using the service, you acknowledge that TRANXFA has no control over, and is not
                responsible for, the quality, safety, legality, or delivery of such goods or services, and that
                any such use of the service is entirely at your own risk. If TRANXFA reasonably believes you are
                using the service to purchase goods or services, we reserve the right to cancel your
                transaction(s).</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.8 Both you and the recipients will only act on your own behalf. You may not submit or receive a
                transaction on behalf of a third person. If you intend to submit or receive a transaction on
                behalf of a company, business, or any entity other than a human individual, you must first
                inform TRANXFA of your desire to do so and provide us with any additional information about the
                entity we may request in order that we may decide whether to permit the transaction.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.9 In using the service, you will comply with these Terms and Conditions, as well as any
                applicable laws, rules, or regulations. It is a breach of these Terms and Conditions to use the
                service to send money (a) to a recipient who has violated the Terms and Conditions, or (b) in
                connection with illegal activity including without limitation money laundering, fraud and the
                funding of terrorist organisations. If you use the service in connection with illegal activity,
                we are obligated to report you to the appropriate legal authorities.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.10 When using our website or the service, or when interacting with TRANXFA, another user, or a
                third party, you will not: breach this Terms and Conditions, or any other agreement between you
                and TRANXFA; open more than one account without our prior written permission; provide false,
                inaccurate, or misleading information; allow anyone else access to your registration details;
                and you will keep those details secure; refuse to provide confirmation of any information you
                provide to us, including proof of identity, or refuse to cooperate in any investigation; use an
                anonymous proxy (a tool that attempts to make activity untraceable); or copy or monitor our
                website using any robot, spider, or other automatic device or manual process, without our prior
                written permission.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">4.11 TRANXFA may, as necessary in providing the service, store all information required of a
                recipient to prove his or her identity or associated with their specific transaction. Such
                proofs may include a suitable form of valid, unexpired identification from a list of acceptable
                papers provided by the service provider, and/or a transaction tracking number, a personal
                identification number (PIN), a password, a secret word, or other similar identifiers.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>

            <p class="text-lg">5.1 If you have any problems using the Service, you should contact us through the channels listed
                at the end of this Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">5.2 You have the statutory right to cancel your agreement with us after you have submitted a
                transaction. This right of cancellation continues until fourteen days after you have submitted
                the transaction, or until we have completed the contract by paying the Payout Amount to the
                Recipient, whichever is the earlier. If you exercise your right to cancel under this clause, we
                may make a cancellation charge.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">5.3 If you wish to exercise your right to cancel under this clause, you must submit a written
                request to one of the contact points listed at the bottom of this Terms and Conditions, giving
                the Sender's full name, address, and phone number, together with the Transaction tracking
                number, Transaction Amount, and the reason for your refund request.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">5.4 Any refunds will be credited back to the same payment instrument used to fund the transaction
                and in the same currency. No adjustment will be made for any currency fluctuations that may have
                occurred in the meantime.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Collection of Information</h2>

            <p class="text-lg">6.1 Customer Identification Program. Canadian law requires all financial institutions to assist
                in the fight against money laundering activities and the funding of terrorism by obtaining,
                verifying, and recording identifying information about all customers. We may therefore require
                you to supply us with personal identifying information, and we may also legally consult other
                sources to obtain information about you.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">6.2 Verification and Checks. We will verify your residential address and personal details in
                order to confirm your identity. We may also pass your personal information to a credit reference
                agency, which may keep a record of that information. You can be rest assured that this is done
                only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed, and that your credit rating
                will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in
                accordance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 (PIPEDA)
                and the Digital Charter Implementation Act 2022 (DCIA) – under review.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">6.3 By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you authorize us to make any inquiries we consider
                necessary to validate the information that you provide to us. We may do this directly, for
                example, by asking you for additional information, requiring you to take steps to confirm
                ownership of your payment instruments or email address; or by verifying your information against
                third-party databases; or through other sources.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">6.4 Data Privacy Policy. You consent to our processing of your personal information for the
                purposes of providing the Service, including verification purposes as set out in this clause.
                You also consent to the use of such data for communicating with you and for statutory,
                accounting, and archival purposes. You acknowledge that you have read and consented to TRANXFA's

            <p class="text-lg">8.1 We will refund to you any benefit that we receive as a result of any breach of our agreement
                with you. This means that, for example, where a money transfer has failed in such circumstances,
                we will refund to you the Transaction Amount and the Service Fee.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">8.2 If a money transfer is delayed or fails, you may have a right to receive a refund or
                compensation under laws relating to the provision of international money transfer services. We
                will provide you with the details of your rights to a refund or compensation if you contact us
                using the contact details at the end of this agreement.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">8.3 Any claim for compensation made by you and/or a Recipient (who is not registered with us)
                must be supported by any available relevant documentation.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">8.4 If any loss that you or a Recipient (who is not registered with us) suffers is not covered by
                a right to payment under the laws referred to in clause 8.2, we will only accept liability for
                that loss up to a limit which is the greater of: (a) the amount of any service charge; and (b)
                C$200, unless otherwise agreed upon by us in writing. Our cap on our liability only limits a
                claim for loss arising out of any single transaction or related transactions, or (if a loss does
                not arise out of a transaction or transactions) any single act, omission, or event or related
                acts, omissions, or events. This means that if, for example, you suffer a loss by reason of our
                failure to perform our agreement with you under two unrelated transactions, you might be able to
                claim up to C$200.</p>
