            <p class=" text-lg  mb-2">TRANXFA INC is committed to providing quality service to our customers. If
                you do not
                receive satisfaction from us, we would like you to tell us about it. All complaints are taken
                seriously, and all feedback is appreciated as it provides us with an opportunity to improve
                our standards. All complaints and feedback are referred on to the relevant directors within
                the business for investigation without delay.</p>

            <p class=" text-lg  mb-2">Complaints Procedure</p>
            <p class=" text-lg  mb-2">If you have a complaint, please contact us at the following address:</p>

            <p class=" text-lg  mb-1">TRANXFA INC</p>
            <p class=" text-lg  mb-1">803-218 SHERWOOD SQUARE NW</p>
            <p class=" text-lg  mb-1">CALGARY, AB TR3 0Y2</p>
            <p class=" text-lg  mb-1">CANADA</p>
            <p class=" text-lg  mb-2">Also via email: hello@tranxfa.ca</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mb-4">
                <li>We will send you a letter or email acknowledging your complaint and confirming its
                    receipt. You should expect to receive this confirmation within 5 working days of our
                    receiving your complaint.</li>
                <li>We will then record your complaint in our central register and start to investigate on your
                    behalf. This is likely to involve the following steps:</li>
                <li>A full response to your complaint will be drafted by the appropriate director and sent to
                    you with any supporting documentary evidence. In addition, if the relevant Director
                    considers it appropriate, she/he may wish to discuss the events surrounding your
                    complaint directly with you. The majority of complaints we receive are resolved in this
                    way, as the Director is able to explain how TRANXFA plans to resolve the issue and, if
                    appropriate, offer an apology or compensation.</li>
                <li>If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can request in writing that the decision of
                    the director to whom the matter was first referred be reviewed. Another more senior
                    Director of the company will be appointed to review the initial decision. We will let you
                    know the outcome of this review in writing as soon as possible. This decision will be
                    final.</li>
                <li>We aim to acknowledge, investigate, and resolve all complaints within 14 working days
                    of receipt.</li>
                <li>If you are still not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint, you can let us know to
                    schedule a virtual meeting to discuss and align on mutually beneficial solution.</li>
